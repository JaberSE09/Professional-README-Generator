# Professional-README-Generator

## Description

This is a Readme Generator from a command line input. The objective was to create a professional readme file from input of the key parts of a readme file.

What I learned is how to grab input from a user through command line and take that and write to a readme file. Thorugh the readme generator I deminstrated the use of node js to complete the generator.
